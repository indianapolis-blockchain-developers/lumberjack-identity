# Maintainers

## About This File

**This guide is for maintainers.** That means people who have write access to this repository, manage merge requests from contributors, and help address issues.

## Who To Contact

Starting with [active contributors](../../graphs/contributors) is an easy way, however you might not get someone's attention right away.

Please note that Maintainers are busy and delegate decision making as a team during our weekly check-in.

We encourage users and contributors to to send us a message on on our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/kSAYmzy) `#identity-project` channel to discuss ideas, features, design, and pull requests.

## Planning and Task Board

We use Trello to organize and plan our project. Cards are used to represent work items, assign task to contributors & maintainers. All items must start in the "Ideas" column, where items will be discussed, debated, voted on, and hopefully moved on the "To Do" column.
